# Extended-CyScope
This is an extention to the CyScope design for Cypress PSoC 5LP processor development boards.
#
This project is an extention of original work from here: https://github.com/Infineon/CyScope

And also work from here: http://eepmagic.mit.edu/page/efirst-oscilloscope.html
#
The project (firmware) for the oscilloscope is written using PSoC Creator. There are two ways to program the project into the kit. You can either open the project in PSoC Creator to program the kit from inside the tool, or you can use PSoC Programmer to download an existing projectâ€™s file to the kit. If you want to modify the project for any reason, PSoC Creator is the tool that you would use.

The creator development software is all free and is available from the following locations. Each row is a superset of the row above it so if you want everything, just download and run the CY8CKIT-059 kit setup installer.
Purpose	/ Web Site:

View and modify the project or create your own custom project and program it to the kit. (The installer includes PSoC Programmer)
